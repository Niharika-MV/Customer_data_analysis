# Customer_data_analysis
data analytics project showcasing customer behaviour analysis using python, sql and powerbi
📊 Data Analytics End-to-End Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights.
The project covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL analysis, dashboard development, and reporting, using industry-relevant tools.

The goal is to showcase practical data analytics skills across Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Power BI, and reporting.

📂 Dataset

Source: Public / Provided dataset

Format: CSV

Description:
The dataset contains structured data used to analyze trends, patterns, and key metrics relevant to the business problem.

(Note: Dataset details can be updated based on the specific domain—sales, finance, operations, etc.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data analysis & visualization

PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL querying

SQL – Analytical queries and aggregations

Power BI – Interactive dashboard development

GAMMA – Report and presentation (PPT) creation

🔍 Project Workflow & Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial inspection to understand structure, data types, and size.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and relationships.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Created visualizations to support insights.

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing and duplicate records.

Standardized formats and corrected data types.

Prepared cleaned data for database ingestion.

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database.

Wrote SQL queries to:

Aggregate key metrics

Identify trends and patterns

Answer business-focused questions

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL.

Built an interactive dashboard featuring:

KPIs

Filters and slicers

Trend and comparison visuals

6. Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytical report summarizing findings.

Designed a professional presentation using GAMMA to communicate insights clearly to stakeholders.

📊 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Interactive filters for deeper analysis

Clear visual storytelling for decision-making
